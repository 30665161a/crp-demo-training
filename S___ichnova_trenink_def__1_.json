It contains information about this whole training and what awaits you in next levels.\n\n\n* \n### Finding open ports\nThe level will test you on some basic commands. Your goal is to find an open port on server.\n\n\n* \n### Connecting Via Telnet\nThis level's challenge is to connect to the server machine without a password and discover the secret answer. Don't worry, you will have a little help there :)\n\n\n* \n### Privilege Escalation\nThis level is a little bit bigger challenge and by that we mean you have to gain root privileges and read an answer available only to a root user. Enjoy! \n\n\n* \n### Test your knowledge\nThis level contains a simple test. This test is supposed to additionally test you, your answers and how much you understand this topic.\n\n\n* \n### Feedback\nThis level contains a simple questionnaire so we will get some feedback and we will be able to make this training better and better.
